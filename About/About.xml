  <description>Adds the possibility to add a changenote on publish/update of mod to the workshop instead of the autogenerated text.
  
The mod looks for a changelog.txt file in the About-folder and adds the content of the current version if possible.
All rows beginning with # are ignored
Rows starting with version-number are checked against the current version and are added if matching
Current version is fetched from the Manifest-file in the same directory (used by Fluffys mod-manager)

--- Example File Content ---
# Changelog for MyMod
# Author is me

1.0.1.0 Fixed a typo in a specific file
1.0.0.0 First publish

--- End of file ---
